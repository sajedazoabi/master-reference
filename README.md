# Founders &amp; Coders

A master reference for the running of [Founders &amp; Coders](http://www.foundersandcoders.org), including the curriculum.

**All pull requests welcome**. Checkout our [contribution guidelines](https://github.com/foundersandcoders/master-reference/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md).

## Curriculum

A curriculum can be thought of as the ordered collection of weeks that students will follow at a given campus. Likewise a week can be thought of as an ordered collection of parts (i.e. a workshop, morning challenge, set of research topics or project).

Below is a list of potential weeks, that might make up a curriculum, and each one's possible parts.
