# A guide to Founders & Coders GitHub repositories

## Public repositories

Since its inception, Founders & Coders has embraced the open-source model for developing curriculum and learning resources. For this reason, most repositories in the Founders & Coders GitHub organisation are _public._ 

**Example of our public repositories include:**

- [`master-reference`](https://github.com/foundersandcoders/master-reference) - a master reference for the running of a Founders & Coders course
- [`our-site`](https://github.com/foundersandcoders/our-site) - the Founders & Coders website
- all workshops (such as [`ws-software-design-js`](https://github.com/foundersandcoders/ws-software-design-js))
- (almost) all projects hosted by the Founders & Coders organisation (such as [`FAC-share`](https://github.com/foundersandcoders/FAC-Share))

## Private repositories

Founders & Coders also uses GitHub to coordinate business specific to the running of each campus and the running of our global charity (currently being incorporated), Founders & Coders International. Frequently, coordination of this nature involves raising issues where it is necessary to share personal information about students and clients. Given the regions in which we operate international programmes (Israel and Gaza), we also find ourselves in a position where participant privacy is directly related to participant safety. 

For these reasons, the following Founders & Coders GitHub repositories are **private** (as of September 2017):

_London:_
- `london-programme`
- `london-employers`
- `london-money`
- `london-premises`
- `london-tasks`

_Nazareth:_
- `nazareth-programme`
- `nazareth-employers`
- `nazareth-money`

_Gaza:_
- `gaza-programme`
- `gaza-employment`
- `gaza-membership`

_International:_
- `international`
- `selection-committee`

_Other:_
- `graduate-mvps`
- `testimonials`
- `freelancing`
- `freelance-networking-and-resources`
- `old-task-groups`

_Client projects:_
- In a small number of cases, we host client projects on private repositories, when we have not yet convinced them of the benefits of open source!

## Accessing private repositories

When someone joins a Founders & Coders course, they are invited to join the Founders & Coders GitHub organisation. All current and past course participants have access to private repositories, unless they have left the GitHub organisation.

A small number of people who have not taken the course are also members of the GitHub organisation. These include staff and trustees of Founders & Coders International, as well as people who have volunteered with the programme.

If you would like to contribute to a private repository, but do not currently have access, please apply for _associate membership_ at your local Founders & Coders programme, or apply to become a member of Founders & Coders International.
